        <p className="p">So Aloa focuses on R&D rather than growth...why?
In 2018, we were standing right where all of our current clients are. We tried outsourcing, and even as a technical team, it was awful.<br></br>

We became obsessed with the whyâ€¦why does everyone hate software outsourcing?<br></br>

We set out to solve our own problems. We built tools to solve our own pain points. Turns out, they solved others' pain points too.</p>
